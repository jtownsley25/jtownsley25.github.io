<h1>Jacob Townsley</h1>
<p>I am a senior at Iowa State University in Ames, IA. I will graduate in May of 2022 with Bachelor of Science degrees in both statistics and data science.
  I am a proficient coder in Python, Java, R, SAS, and SQL. I completed a significant project in December 2021 for a class I took regarding multivariate analysis.
  This project involved data visualization, clustering, classification, inference of means, and MANOVA for world economic data over multiple years. Shown below is
  a graphic that was used in the final report that shows individual distributions of eight different analyized variables.</p>
